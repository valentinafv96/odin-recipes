# odin-recipes

In this project I have tried to use all the knowledge acquired in __HTML__, thanks to the _Odin Project_, through the creation of a very simplified website that links to three recipes chosen by me:

* __Rice Pudding__
* __Margherita Pizza__
* __Shrimps cocktail__

This recipes are present in different webpages in which it is included an __image__ of the corresponding recipe, the list of the necessary __ingredients__ and the __steps__ needed to complete the process.
