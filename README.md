# odin-recipes

In this project I have tried to use all the knowledge acquired in HTML, thanks to the Odin Project, through the creation of a very simplified website that links to three recipes chosen by me:

*Rice Pudding
*Margherita Pizza
*Shrimps cocktail

This recipes are present in different webpages in which it is included an image of the corresponding recipe, the list of the necessary ingredients and the steps needed to complete the process.
